# Steam Game Path

## How does it work?
It looks for the path with given game id, and returns both steam installation path and game's.

## Installing
```npm install csgogsi```

## Example #1
```javascript
import { getGamePath } from 'steam-game-path';

const data = getGamePath(730);
```

## Exports
